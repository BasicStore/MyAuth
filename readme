SPRING SECURITY WEBSERVICE APPLICATION

- look into the Users / user [obj v db table] issue. Maybe just remove table attribute in Users.
  Note it is not as simple as replacing User.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RUN THE APP:
localhost:8080/rest/hello/all
localhost:8080/rest/hello/admin/all

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NEXT STEPS:

- build understanding 
  --> DONE add jsps to the example
  --> NOT_WORKING apply bespoke login page
      --> needs to be part of Spring MVC app for the view resolver to work            
  --> DONE add bespoke error handling page 
  --> DONE test multi-roles on the same resource
  --> DINE how to add multiple configurations for complex authorization?
      - for example: a guest not get past the login page, does the app know automatically once
                     signed in that an admin has rights for member and user level resources?
  --> NO, SPECIFY ALL EXPLICITLY is there a hierarchy of authority? Or must all permissions be added to DB explicitly for OOB use?
  --> how to apply to actual login page:  add --> .loginPage("/login")  
  --> add to spring mvc apps
